# The Inner Join
- Selects records from two tables that hold **matching values**
  - Records that donâ€™t hold matching values are excluded from the output
- The query compares each row of the first table with rows of the second table to find rows that satisfy the condition


# Example:

## Here are two tables, Orders and Customers

## The **SELECT** statement below shows which columns between the two tables are going to be included in the output.
```
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
```

## Records from both tables that hold matching values are highlighted:
```
FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustID=Customers.CustID;
```

## The result of the following statement...
```
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate 
FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustID=Customers.CustID;
```
## ...is shown below:
